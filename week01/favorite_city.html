    <p>As the nation's primary city, Monrovia is the country's economic, financial and cultural center. Its economy is
        primarily centered on its harbor and its role as the seat of Liberian government. Monrovia's economy is largely
        based on
        its position as chief Atlantic port of Liberia, with the Freeport of Monrovia based in the city being the
        largest and
        main port in Liberia.
