        <h1>Exercise: Block vs. Inline Elements</h1>
        <p class="note">Some basic styling has been applied in order to illustrate the elements structure and
            boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Task 1: Swap Block and Inline Elements</h2>
        <span>In the HTML of this document, change this div element to a span element.</span>

        <p class="question">What happens to the layout? Does it still take up the full width? NO, IT DOES NOT TAKE UP
            THE FULL WIDTH AGAIN; INSTEAD IT TAKES UN THE GIVEN SPACE BY THE "span tag" ONLY.</p>

        <h2>Task 2: Nesting Inline in Block</h2>
        <p>A paragraph &lt;p&gt; element (block) with a <span>&lt;span&gt; element;</span></p>
        <p class="question">Add another inline element like &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; inside the paragraph. Observe
            how it flows within the line. OBSERVATION: The "span tag" element tag inside the "p tag" block element
            do not start on a new line, it only takes up the space given by the "span element" and aligned inside of the
            "p tag" block level. Interestingly, the block element takes up the entire width of the screen while the
            "span element" alings inside of it.
        </p>

        <h2>Task3: Nesting Block in Inline</h2>
        <span>Try placing a <div> &lt;div&gt; inside a </div> &lt;span&gt; element.</span>
        <p class="question">What error or layout issue do you see? Why does this happen? BECAUSE: a "div" is a block
            level element and always start on a new line and takes on the entire width of the screen, so when a "div"
            element is placed or nested inside an inline element-it starts on a new line and takes up full width of the
            screen.</p>


        <h2>Task 4: Review the HTML markup of the following Inline Elements</h2>
        &lt;img&gt; element
        <img src="images/castle.webp" alt="placeholder image (images are inline)" width="300" height="300">
        <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">&lt;a&gt; anchor element</a>
        <button type="button">&lt;button&gt;</button>

        <!-- added a span element tag for the response:  -->
        <em> RESPONSE: THE (img, a, and button) ELEMENTS ARE INLINE BLOCK LEVEL ELEMENT
            tags
            THAT DO NOT START ON A NEW LINE INSTEAD THEY ONLY TAKE THE SPACE THEY ARE GIVEN BY THE TAGS. IN THIS CASE,
            WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT
            THEY ARE ALIGNED HORIZONTALLY, HOWEVER THE IMAGE ASSUMES TAKING THE FULL HEIGHT BY DEFAULT.</em>
